			<h1 class="section-titles">Introduction</h1>
			<p>I consider myself an intermediate marketer and web developer in the professional world outside of my typical business admin functions.  I am the General Manager for <a href="http://synlawnbayarea.com"><strong>SYNLawn Bay Area</strong></a>, a synthetic grass installation landscape company and am looking to improve our current website which I built from scratch.</p>

			<p>I am passionate about marketing and web design and am constantly challenging myself to reach the next level of both practices.  I have recently challenged myself with taking on the creative portion of our social media and overhauling our website.  The parts of web design that continue to elude me yet keep my thoughts going toward a solution are how to make our website mobile, how to code javascript, and how to build a responsive search bar on our webpage including building a database for it.</p>

			<p>Enviroments I tend to thrive in are those with plenty of integrity, creativity and productive collaboration.  Continuous education and growth are critical as well to life enrichment and I like to consider myself a lifelong student.</p>

			<h1 class="section-titles">Where I'm From</h1>
			<p>I was born and raised in Silicon Valley, California and consider myself lucky to be born near the home of our great founding technological fathers Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs (may he rest in peace).  I finished my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and MBA in Marketing at Golden Gate University in San Francisco, CA.</p>

			<h1 class="section-titles">More About Me</h1>
			<h2 class="subsection-titles">What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
			<p>My favorite hobbies are video games (I play World of Warcraft), cooking and eating healthy, and soon enough I will be getting back into working out.  I also enjoy spending time with my cat and going out with friends for a walk or some delicious sushi.</p>

			<h2 class="subsection-titles">What's your dream job?</h2>
			<p>My dream job is supporting a successful company’s growth through marketing, web design and general business admin.  These are my strengths and I thrive when I am in an environment where my talents are appreciated and I can see the fruits of my labor in the form of company growth and success.</p>

			<h2 class="subsection-titles">What's your background?</h2>
			<p>I developed my interest in coding while working toward my AAS in Comupter Technology from Heald College.  This is where I built my first website in old school html (CSS didn't exist to me then as it had only been out a few years and our professors were not onto it).  I later pursued further education in information technology and marketing. Web design has been a passion of mine along with marketing as the two go hand-in-hand.</p>

			<h2 class="subsection-titles">What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
			<p>Lately I have been listening to Pandora Radio and enjoy the “Samurai Champloo” and “Atlas Genius” channels.  The music is out of the ordinary but keeps me motivated and focused without too much distraction while I work.</p>
